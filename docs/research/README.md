## 🔑 Key Findings

### ✅ HTTP Head is Feasible

The research confirms that adding HTTP transport to Adjutant is technically feasible and can be implemented in **8-10 days** for a minimum viable product.

### ⭐ Recommended Solution

**OAuth Device Code Flow** for headless authentication:
- User authenticates from any device (phone, laptop)
- No browser required on server
- Fully containerizable
- Supported by Microsoft and Google

### 🏗️ Architecture

```
AI Client (HTTP/SSE) → K8s Pod → Persistent Volume
                        ├─ ASP.NET Core Server
                        ├─ Admin Web UI (Blazor)
                        ├─ Device Code Auth
                        └─ Encrypted Token Storage
```

### 🔒 Security Model

Single-user private environment:
- No public internet exposure
- Access via port-forward or VPN
- Custom token encryption
- Admin API authentication

## 📋 Implementation Phases

| Phase | Description | Days | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| 1 | HTTP/SSE Transport | 2-3 | P1 |
| 2 | Device Code Auth | 3-4 | P1 |
| 3 | Admin Web UI | 4-5 | P2 |
| 4 | Container/K8s | 3-4 | P2 |
| 5 | Enhanced Features | Var | P3 |

**MVP**: Phases 1-2 = **8-10 days**
